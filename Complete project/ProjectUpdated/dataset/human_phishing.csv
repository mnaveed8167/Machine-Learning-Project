Helga is already working on a shrine.  Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASA’s Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon — using its most powerful rocket ever. There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off. (Here’s how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The mission’s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon’s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon’s surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASA’s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it’s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth.  And Also...ThisWhat’s got us trying to read in between the lines…The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.” Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.What’s got parents talking…Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Who’s GOAT us in our feels…Serena Williams. Tonight at 7 pm ET, the tennis legend will play her first round at the US Open. All eyes are on the court since this is expected to be her last tournament…ever. Watch the final curtain call here.While the VMAs had us saying ‘Industry Baby’...Taylor Swift had us up until midnight.Skimm MoneySponsored by They call it *personal* finance for a reason.

Helga is already working on a shrine.  Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASA’s Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon — using its most powerful rocket ever. There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off. (Here’s how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The mission’s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon’s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon’s surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASA’s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it’s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth.  And Also...ThisWhat’s got us trying to read in between the lines…The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.” Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.What’s got parents talking…Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Who’s GOAT us in our feels…Serena Williams. Tonight at 7 pm ET, the tennis legend will play her first round at the US Open. All eyes are on the court since this is expected to be her last tournament…ever.

**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

**CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm)**

A Sedate Smoking or Brewing Happiness Botanical.

Capillaris Loose-leaf Herba is a very calming, happy sort of smoking/brewing herba. Capillaris Herba is a singular botanical and is best utilized close to bedtime as it is a very sedate herba. Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.

Capillaris Herba botanical is best rolled or bowled when engaged as a ""Smoka."" As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) 

Capillaris Herba is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Capillaris Herba is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Capillaris Herba not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.

AQUEOUS KATHMANDU
*********************************

For those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu ""Happy Drops"" (tm).

Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops....(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety)....Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. ""Secret Fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! 

As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""Sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple ""Quantum"" Variety, a.k.a....""Secret Fire"".  ""Secret fire""....indeed!!!

This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""Smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""Smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""Smoke"" and a ""non-Smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each ""impeccable"" singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple ""3"" Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (Please refer to, ""Introductory Offers"".)

Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).

STONEY MAHONEY
**************************

In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""Sensitive/Responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""Amsterdam Cup"" style so to speak!

With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), Weed (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  

After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""Signature Significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""Absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnt get any ""sweeter"" than this!  

And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnt so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional ""Kind Bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up ""Sativa"" sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney Mahoneys draw.  

* Indica oriented.
* Definitely happy smoking!
* Mood enhancer.
* Smokeable & brewable mood food!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
* Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!
* Hornier than horny goatweed!
* Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.
* Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
* Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
* Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
* Non-invasive.
* Absolutely Legal!
* Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.

Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for thee.)

Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""Personal Choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.

Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""Sensitive/Responsive,"" Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.

As is an herbalists way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)

Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Stoney Mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....
